## How the Smart Contract Works

The `BiotechInvestmentBundle` contract enables minting of biotech investment bundles and buying fractional ownership.  
Key Functions:
- `mintBundle()`
- `buyShare()`
- `getShare()`
- `bundleInfo()`

Ownership percentages are recorded directly inside the contract for transparency.
